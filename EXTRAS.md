# EXTRAS

Extras are link plugins. They are small programs that help your program. To link it just insert `<script src="extras/EXTRA_NAME.js"></script>`. This will conect your program to other intergrations

# DEVELOPING EXTRAS

If you would like to create an extra's just make a commit in github to the extra's branch. If it is a good idea for a extra I will add it to the extra branch.

In your extra please include:

A License

A README file.

A QUICK START (Can be in your readme file.)

A DISCRIPTION (What it does, etc...)

CONTACT INFO (Can be a contact form, Email, etc...)

ATRIBUTION (Did you use some code from somewhere else? EX: INSTALINK)

# DEVELOPING EXTRA STYLES.

InstaLink is only looking for a couple types of styles. This makes it very easy to create a style sheet.

InstaLink is only looking for these tags

`.link`

**_DO NOT CHANGE THESE TAGS_**

`.img`

`.Atribution`

`.header`

These tags must stay for proper atribution!!!

You must also include:

A README file.

A QUICK START (Can be in your readme file.)

A DISCRIPTION (What it does, etc...)
