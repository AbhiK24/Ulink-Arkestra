# EXTRAS

Extras are link plugins. They are small programs that help your program. To link it just insert `<script src="extras/EXTRA_NAME.js"></script>`. This will conect your program to other intergrations

# DEVELOPING EXTRAS

If you would like to create a Extra please create an issue or ask a question in the discussions page in the main reprository.

If you are going to create an extra you **must** include:

A LICENSE & ATRIBUTION (Did you use some code from somewhere else? EX: I used code from Benja-Media/Instalink on github)

A README file. In your README file please include:

  - A QUICK START (Tell people how to set it up)

  - A DISCRIPTION (What it does, etc...)

  - SCREENSHOT. (Show people what it looks like.)

# DEVELOPING EXTRA STYLES.
